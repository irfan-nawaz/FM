Objects:

    - The key in object's key value pair will be auto converted to string if in case if we want to give numbers we have to give key in string (i.e "").

    - Dots can be seen on:
                            -   a method on an object,
                            -   with functions like (promise.then),
                            -   with array's methods,
                            -   nested objects,
                            -   prototype methods,
                            -   spreaqd operator,...

    Note: Anything with dot in JavaScript is an object


primitive values:
     
    - They will be stored directly in memory and if we create another primitive value then it will be stored in new memory location so we dont have to worry about the previous code.

    - Called pass by value.

    ex: string, number, boolian, null, undefined,...

Non- primitive:
    - Stored in memory which being refrenced by anotehr memory(pointer) the memory points to another memory location where it is actually stored, we need to worry if we change later as the previous lines of code might get affected if this non-primitive is used before.

    - Called pass by refrence.

    ex: object, array, function,...

Arrays:
    - Arrays are objects with some of their propritary methods.
    - arrays are propritarily stored in key pairs of strings "0","1",,,
    - but we can also store other key value pairs inside an array like array.name = "arrayName".
    - we can access such above key value pair by object notation (i.e console.log(array.name).)
    - but adding key value pairs other than numerical indices will not increase the lenth of array.
    - the usual array's key value pairs(numerical indices) can be accessed by using bracket notataion (i.e consoe.log(array[0]).)



Bracket Notation:
    - in brackets used for objects or arrays we can perform following:
                                                                        - pass numbers,
                                                                        - pass strings
                                                                        - perform mathematial operations
                                                                        - pass IFFE functions,...



Non-Valid Characters: (',^,&,*,....)
    - Try to avoid using these non-valid characters as your object's keys.
    - if in case you have to then use them in a bracket notation (ex -> obj["^'&*"] = "value").
    - 


Destructuring:
    - It is a smilpler way to variable declaration which can save time by non-repetiton.
