Higher-Order Functions(HOF):
    - HOF is what enables us to do functional Programming techniques.
    - HOF can take another function as input and also we can return a function as an output.
    - Function in javascript is a data, unlike many other programing languages.
    - data means we can be able to pass functions around, return them without invoking, just like an object or any primitive ds.

Callbacks: 
    - Callbacks are just functions that we pass to functions.

Reduce: 
    - Reduce is a method that return a single value froma a function,
    For Array:
        - Reduce method takes two arguments, 
            - the first a callback function with 2 parameters named accumulator and current value.
            - second one is optional i.e initial value. Tip: we can initialize initial value to an empty array or object to declate their data type.

    For Object: 
        - Reduce method take two arguments 
            - the first a callback function with 3 parameters named accumulator, current value and key.
            - second is optional i.e initial value. Tip: we can initialize initial value to an empty array or object to declate their data type.

        - Note if initial value in not given then accumulator will hold first element of the list and cuurent value will hold 2nd element of the list for the first iteration.

            - accumulator:
                - accumulator is like a memory, over every iteration the operation performed by the reduce callback will be stored in the accumulator.
            - currentValue:
                - currentValue is the current value of the array iteration we take the current value and perform some operation with accumulator.
            - initialValue:
                - initialValue is the value that will be set into the accumulator in the first iteration.
                - if initialValue is not passed as the argument then the fitst element of the list will become the initialValue and 2nd element of the list will become the current value.
