Function Usage:
    - instead of re-writing same come again and agian we can declare that repeating piece of code in a function can call function multiple times to run that code.
    - we can genralize functions to make them more resuable. For ex: we can dynamically decide the value of parameters at the time of funcion call through arguments.
    - with functions we can avoid (D.R.Y) principle

Higher Order Functions:
    - Any function that takes in or returns out a function is called higher order function.
    - we may not want to decide exactly what some functionality is untill we run the function.
    - In higher order functions we can not only leave our parameters TBD during execution but also some code can be left as TBD untill the execution of the function.
    - yhis will make our functions super reusable and super general.

Callback Functions: 
    - they are functions passsed into higher order functions the callback function can be dynamically delcared during the higher order function call.

Functions are Firt Class Objects:
    - functions have all features of objects.
    - first class menas all the features will be present.

Methods: 
    - Methods are functions stores as properties of other objects.

Arrow Functions: 
    - arrow functions are short hand for normal functions. 
    - but there are changes under the hood.
